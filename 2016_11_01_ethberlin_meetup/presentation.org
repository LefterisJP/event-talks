* What is the Raiden Network
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

- Off chain Asset Transfer Network
- Similar to the Bitcoin Lightning Network
- Under Development, working towards an MVP

* Raiden Features
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

- Compatible with ERC20 Standard Token ABI
- Instant Asset Transfers
- Micropayments
- Has potential to scale to even 1 million transactions per second.
- Transactions are confidential

* How Does It work
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

* Payment Channel
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
Comprised of a smart contract.

- With a Deposit
- Channel can be closed by any party
- Channel settlement with challenge period

* Payment Channel
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

All balances are updated off-chain.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70% :class noborder
[[./images/channel.png]]

* Bidirectional Channel
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Two deposits
- Settlement is comprised of two netted balances
- Nodes track their own balance
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70% :class noborder
[[./images/bidirectionalchannel.png]]

* Chaining Channels
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Transfers between not connected parties can be mediated
- HashLocks H(secret), still no trust required
- Secret revealed once A learns, that C signed for D
- Each node can charge a small fee
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70% :class noborder
[[./images/chainedchannel.png]]

* Network of channels
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Routes between any two participants
- Channels can be long lived, since transfers cancel out
- Low Frequency of on-chain settlements.
- Vast Majority of Transactions off-chain:
  - Cheaper (no gas costs)
  - Fast (no need to deal with the chain)
  - Maintain no counterparty risk

#+BEGIN_NOTES
By embedding the payment conditional upon knowledge of a secure cryptographic
 hash, payments can be made across a network of channels without the need for
 any party to have unilateral custodial ownership of funds.
 The Raiden Network enables what was previously not possible with trusted
 financial systems vulnerable to monopolies—without the need for custodial
 trust and ownership, participation on the network can be dynamic and open
 for all.

* Example: Decentralized Exchange
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Need channel for both assets
- Exchange intent is broadcast by the initiator
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50% :class noborder
  [[./images/exchangeintent.png]]
- Interested parties send an Exchange Request
- Initiator accepts

* 2 Transfers 1 Hashlock
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
Once the initiator accepts then: 
- Two mediated transfers with the same Hashlock
- Either both or none executes

* Comparison with the Lightning Network
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Easier implementation thanks to Ethereum's EVM
- Uncooperative participants don’t lock the channel
- Works with any ERC20 compatible token
- Interopable with smart contracts

* Project Status
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Can be implemented with current version of Ethereum.
- Demonstrated 500 transfers per CPU core per second.
- Is a work in progress.
