* What is the Raiden Network
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <br />

#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Offchain Asset Transfer Network
- Similar to the Bitcoin Lightning Network
- Developed by Brainbot AG
- Under Development, working towards an MVP
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 12% height: 12% :class notransparency

* Raiden Features
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <br />

#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Compatible with ERC20 Standard Token ABI
- Instant Asset Transfers
- Micropayments
- Has potential to scale to even 1 million transactions per second.
- Transactions are confidential

By utilizing something called payment channels.

* Payment Channel
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
Comprised of a smart contract that:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Has a  Security Deposit
- Channel can be closed by any party
- Channel settlement with challenge period

* Payment Channel
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

All balances are updated off-chain.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70% :class noborder
[[./images/channel.png]]

* Bidirectional Channel
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Two deposits
- Settlement is comprised of two netted balances
- Each participant tracks both balances
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :height 80% :class noborder
[[./images/bidirectionalchannel.png]]

* Chaining Channels
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
- Transfers between not connected parties can be mediated
- Through using hashlocks there is no trust required.
- Secret revealed once A learns, that C signed for D
- Each node can charge a small fee
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70% :class noborder
[[./images/chainedchannel.png]]

* Network of channels
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Routes between any two participants
- Channels can be long lived, since transfers cancel out
- Low Frequency of on-chain settlements.
- Vast Majority of Transactions off-chain:
  - Cheaper (no gas costs)
  - Fast (no need to deal with the chain)
  - Maintain no counterparty risk

#+BEGIN_NOTES
By embedding the payment conditional upon knowledge of a secure cryptographic
 hash, payments can be made across a network of channels without the need for
 any party to have unilateral custodial ownership of funds.
 The Raiden Network enables what was previously not possible with trusted
 financial systems vulnerable to monopolies—without the need for custodial
 trust and ownership, participation on the network can be dynamic and open
 for all.

* Example: Decentralized Exchange
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
#+REVEAL_HTML: <br />
#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Need a channel open for both assets
- Exchange intent is broadcast by the initiator
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50% :class noborder
  [[./images/exchangeintent.png]]
- Interested parties send an Exchange Request
- Initiator accepts

* 2 Transfers with 1 Hashlock
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:

#+REVEAL_HTML: <br />
Once the initiator accepts then: 
- Two mediated transfers with the same Hashlock
- Either both or none executes

* Comparison with the Lightning Network
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
#+REVEAL_HTML: <br />

#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Easier implementation thanks to Ethereum's EVM
- Uncooperative participants don’t lock the channel
- Funds can be added to existing channels
- Works with any ERC20 compatible token
- Interopable with smart contracts

* Project Status
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ../common_images/bg1.jpg
:END:
#+REVEAL_HTML: <br />
#+ATTR_HTML: :class spaciousbullets
- Can be implemented with current version of Ethereum.
- Demonstrated 500 transfers per CPU core per second.
- Is a work in progress.
