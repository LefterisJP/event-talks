#+BEGIN_NOTES
Ethereum is a public blockchain platform with programmable transaction functionality. It provides
a decentralized virtual machine that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency
called Ether. 

People can write programs that are deployed in the ethereum blockchain. These programs have come
to be known as smart contracts. They function as little black boxes of code that execute their code as soon as they are activated by some external stimuli.

The blockchain combined with the smart contracts is what makes Ethereum a unique blockchain platform
for what we have come to refer to as Decentralized Applications (Dapps). Such applications could be
Token Systems, Identity and Reputation Systems, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations etc.

- Nodes create transactions and send them to the network
- Miners get the transactions, verify them and include them in their blocks.
- All nodes sync new blocks from the network and thus build the blockchain. 

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Every user that runs an Ethereum node and has an account can create trasnactions and push them to
the network.

Miners are the people who create new blocks and add them to the blockchain. They verify
all the transactions that exist in the network and if succesfull include them in the new
blocks they are creating.

All ethereum nodes continuously synchronize with the network, download new blocks and after verifying
them they add them to their local copy of the blockchain. This is how the blockchain's ledger is
continuously being built all around the world in a decentralized fashion

The Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, although it does have some differences.
The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin,
Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from that, two other values,
the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Each ethereum account address is generated from the ECDSA private key/public key pair. A pair of keys
according to the ECDSA algorithm is created and then the ethereum address will be the rightmost
20-bytes of the public key.

An account contains 4 fields:
1. The nonce, a counter used to make sure each transaction can only be processed once.
2. The account's current balance
3. The account's code. Can also be NULL.
4. The account's storage. Is empty by default.

Due to the amount of computational steps required in many of the parts of the Ethereum ecosystem
you will often see many denominations of Ether. One ether is equal to:

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Gas is very important in the Ethereum ecosystem. It's what is used for the anti denial of service property
of Ethereum. In order to prevent accidental or hostile infinite loops each compuatational step has an associated
cost. The fundamental unit of computation is Gas. Most computations cost 1 Gas but as expected some computations
cost more because they increase amount of data that must be stored as part of the state.

#+NAME: Ether
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 55% height: 55%
[[./images/mining_rig.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Mining is the implementation of the concensus system by all the nodes in the network.
Nodes in the network continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called "blocks".
each block containing a timestamp, a nonce, a reference to (ie. hash of) the previous block
and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block.
Over time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, "blockchain" that constantly updates
to represent the latest state of the ledger.

Ethash is the Proof Of Work algorithm used in the Ethereum network atm. It's the algorithm
that is used to either verify an existing block or mine a new block. It is a modified version of
the Dagger Hashimoto Algorithm.

DIFFERENCES TO BITCOIN:
The main difference with the Bitcoin PoW algorithm is the fact that Ethash is designed to be ASIC resistant.
An ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) is a microchip designed for a special application, in this case crypto currency mining algorithms.
ASICs are considered really harmful by the community and it was a high priority to have an ASIC resistant algorithm.

The ASIC resistnce is This is achieved by requiring a lot of memory, which when implemented on an ASIC, translates to needing lots of physical area on the chip.
ASIC implementations derive their power from having many physically parallel and pipelined threads on one chip, each requiring a certain
piece of chip real estate. Now if your algorithm requires lots of real estate even for one step of the pipeline, there will not
be much room to actually parallelize or pipeline the algorithm. Thereby you will lose the parallelizing advantage of an ASIC implementation.

* Transactions

#+NAME: Ethereum Transaction
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 55% height: 55%
[[./images/transaction.png]]

Signed messages sent from externally owned accounts
- Contain fields with details of the transaction.
- They cost gas
- Contracts execute code when receiving them

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A transaction in Ethereum is a signed data message that's sent from an externally owned account.
A transaction contains:
 - The message's recipient
 - The message's sender identified by a Signature.
 - The amount of ether to be transferred. This is called *endowment* for contract creation transactions.
 - An optional data field.
 - A *Gas* value. Represent the maximum gas to be used and to be credited to the sender's account.
   If the sender does not have enough gas or if the amount of gas required for the transaction exceeds
   this limit, then the transaction is rejected.
 - A *GASPrice*. The price of Gas in ether. Basically the fee the sender pays per computational step.
   Default is 50 Shannon.

If the message's recipient is a contract then its code will be executed.

The optional data field also adds to the transaction's Gas since there is a fee of 5 Gas for each byte of the Data.
With the existence of the Gas System an attacker is required to pay roportionately for every resource that they
consume, including computation, bandwidth and storage; hence, any transaction that leads to the network consuming a
greater amount of any of these resources must have a gas fee roughly proportional to the increment.
#+END_NOTES

* Messages
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_background: ./bg1.jpg
:END:
#+NAME: Ethereum Messages
[[./images/contractmessages.png]]

- Exist only in the execution environment
- Same attributes as transactions
- May have a limited gas stipend


#+BEGIN_NOTES
Contracts have the ability to send "messages" to other contracts. Messages are virtual objects that are never serialized
and exist only in the Ethereum execution environment. A message contains:

 - The sender of the message
 - The recipient of the message
 - The amount of ether to transfer with the message
 - An optional data field.
 - A *Gas* value.

A message then, is like a transaction with the main difference that it is produced by a contract and not by an
externally owned account. Whenever a contract execute's the *CALL* opcode a message is produced and executed.

Also like a transaction if a message's recipient is a contract then its code will be executed. In this way
contracts can actually interact with each other.

Note than in such case the Gas allowance applies to both the contract and any other contracts it calls to.
For example, if an external actor A sends a transaction to B with 1000 gas, and B consumes 600 gas before
sending a message to C, and the internal execution of C consumes 300 gas before returning, then B can spend
another 100 gas before running out of gas.

* State transition
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
#+NAME: State transition
[[./images/state_transition.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The Ethereum state transition function, =APPLY(S,TX)->'S= can be defined as:

1. Check if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number of values), the signature is valid, and
   the nonce matches the nonce in the sender's account. If not, return an error.
2. Calculate the transaction fee as STARTGAS * GASPRICE, and determine the sending address from the signature.
   Subtract the fee from the sender's account balance and increment the sender's nonce. If there is not enough balance to spend, return an error.
3. Initialize GAS = STARTGAS, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte to pay for the bytes in the transaction.
4. Transfer the transaction value from the sender's account to the receiving account. If the receiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving account is a contract, run the contract's code either to completion or until the execution runs out of gas.
5. If the value transfer failed because the sender did not have enough money, or the code execution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the payment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner's account.
6. Otherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and send the fees paid for gas consumed to the miner.

#+NAME: EVM
[[./images/evm.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as
"Ethereum virtual machine code" or "EVM code".

The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an operation. In general, code execution
is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter
(which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached
 or an error or STOP or RETURN instruction is detected.

All computations have access to three places where they can store data:

- The *Stack*, a LIFO container to which values are pushed and popped.
- *Memory* an infinitely expandable byte array
- The long term *storage* of the contract which is a key/value store. Unlike stack and memory which reset
  once a computation ends, storage persists for the long term.

The code can also access the value, sender and data of the incoming message, as well as block header data,
and the code can also return a byte array of data as an output.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The available multiplicity of Ethereum development languages is important because it enables
developers to pick the ones they like in order to more easily and efficiently write Decentralized
Applications (ÐApps).

A ÐApp is the combined set of smart contracts and client-side code that enables them. Smart
contracts are like cryptographic “boxes” that contain a value and only unlock it if certain
conditions are met. They typically encapsulate some logic, rules, a process, or an agreement
between parties.

A ÐApp can be viewed architecturally as being very similar to a traditional web application,
with one difference: in a traditional web application, you have client side Javascript code
that is run by users inside their browsers and server-side code that is run by a host or
company; but in a ÐApp, you instead have smart logic running on the blockchain, and client side code
running in one of the Ethereum Clients.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO”) - more specifically, it is a new breed of human organization
never before attempted. The DAO is borne from immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code, operated entirely by
its members, and fueled using ETH which Creates DAO tokens. Several aspects of this structure make it revolutionary:

Inclusion: The DAO leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone, anywhere in the world can be
empowered to participate. In exchange for their early help, participants receive DAO tokens which hold many benefits.

Flexibility: The DAO backs Proposals which it selects for their innovative nature, to be delivered by Contractors. Some 
of these Proposals could hold no promise of return whatsoever (in the case of a charity for example), others could involve
the building of products or services which The DAO could then use for its own purposes.

Profitability and Growth: The DAO charges for the use of its the products or services. This revenue is then sent directly
to The DAO in the form of ETH. The DAO then has the option to accumulate this ETH to support its growth, or redistribute
it to the DAO Token Holders as a reward.

Autonomous Governance: The ETH held by The DAO will never be centrally managed. DAO Token Holders are able to vote on
important decisions relating to the management of The DAO, including the power to redistribute its ETH amongst themselves.

The DAO, represented by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain at address 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413,
intends to back a series of Proposals to create products or services. The DAO Token Holders will then leverage these
product or services, or charge others for using them.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A Curator is a failsafe mechanism that indirectly prevents malicious actors from executing 51% attack.
Curators do not add centralization to the DAO: they are nominated by the DAO Token Holders themselves,
and can be fired at any time, for any reason. Curators curate the whitelist, the list of Contractors
authorized to receive ether from the DAO.

Note that the above has an added advantage: it prevents someone from acquiring 51% of the tokens then passing a Proposal sending himself 100% of The DAO’s ETH. This idea originates from a blog post by Vitalik Buterin. The very possibility of a split indeed renders this attack moot: the legit minority would stay with its current Curator holding 100% of their own ETH, while the majority attacker would be left without Curator, and with only the ETH they put in themsel

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Token holders may end up wanting to change the curators or create their own mini-DAO. This is possible through a process
called splitting. The split is a way for people to move out of the main DAO and move the ether that was backing their tokens
into the new Child DAO.

The tokens they owned in the main DAO are burned and new tokens are created in the child DAO. This is done via a special
proposal to the DAO, called the Split Proposal. A split proposal:

- Requires 7 days to mature once created
- During this maturity period anyone who wants to join the split has to vote for it
- After the period expires by calling the =splitDAO()= function anyone can join the new DAO
- The new DAO goes through a 27 Days  creation phase much like the original DAO.
